        <h2>HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE</h2>
        <p>This guide is complementary to information you receive from AUASâ€™s International Offices.</p>
        <p>
          For example,
          we put together an overview with essentials that you might need at the beginning of your stay. In the first part of the book, called First Things First, you will find important information about AUAS and living in Amsterdam. In the second part of the book you will find information that might be less important, but nice to know all the same. This part is called Opposites Attract and each chapter focuses on a contrast. The contrast between Work x Play for instance will tell you about the libraries on and off campus, but it will also show you where you can blow off some steam when the workday is done.</p>
